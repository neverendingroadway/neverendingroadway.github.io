	<p>
	Let me start with a question.
	<span class="mb-3 font-weight-bold"> Are you a hurricane or the butterfly who can bring that hurricane?</span>
	</br>
	</br>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	  I think to answer above question you must need to know what is my point of view on that. We are living in a society which is changing day by day. Change is the part of nature and we must adopt new things and get rid of older, Sometimes it is good, sometimes it is bad. So, to continue this process we have adopted technologies, today we have internet and we have tons of information about everything, more than anyone ever had on this planet. But in the era of this new world our head is bombarded with too much information, information that we process day by day without even thinking, analyzing, or validating. We believe what we hear, we believe what we see, on news, on social media, from peoples. We make assumptions, we take our decision so quickly and no matter what, we stick to that hollow decision based on that information which we did not even validate, very firmly.
	<span>
	</p>
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	Our mind has been paralyzed so much that we have lost our capability to differentiate between right or wrong, common sense is not always common, totally agree on that. We are living in an extraordinary and complicated environment, we do not have time, we do not have energy or capacity to retaliate that information before processing and to process that we look for shortcuts. Shortcuts? Yes shortcuts, like a template. What are those shortcuts? Well sometimes it is our out of box thinking, thinking in all dimensions, and sometimes they are our stereotypes. You can call it as rule of thumb which we have learnt so far from our life experiences or from our culture or from our people, in an enclosed environment. 
	</span>
	
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	Stereotypes? Yes, when something is happening near to our environment , people we talk or listen, video or posts we see on internet , we take help of these stereotypes triggers which are already wired in our mind by our life experiences to identify and understand behavior of that incoming information. 
It could be anything, for example, if somebody is listening sad songs or love songs, he might be in pain or in love. If somebody is going to temple, he might be a devotee, if somebody does not have car or looking simple, he might not be rich, if somebody does not have white collar job he is not well respected in this society, if someone is black or ugly he might not have a good heart or not worth saying even Hello, if somebody does not like government job he might be a fool or if somebody has quit the well earning job and chasing his dreams he must be stupid, if somebody is not saving much and enjoying his life doing what he loves then for most of the people he is wasting his time, They are just a few examples of our stereotypes.

	</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	So, let me bring you back on information processing thing I was talking about. We don’t have time or energy to think about that incoming information in some different points of view, We want shortcuts so we can make a quick judgement and move on from that thing and once we make that judgement we add that on the top of those stack of our previous life experiences. We do not even care whether the incoming information could be wrong, biased, partially true or half shared. We believe what our inner stereotype says about that. We process that without knowing the impact of the destruction it could cause if they were not real without having any idea how manipulative and complicated problem that could be. We easily get convinced by someone’s thoughts thinking they are ours. This is like butterfly effect; a butterfly flatters its wing and it caused hurricane on the other side of the world. There are some set of people, powered by the powerful who claims themselves as a Gods of the world, who are  well trained, psychologically structured and, to play with our triggers and make us believe in the message they are delivering. They play with our mind without letting us know.
	</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	We make choices, we think free, thinking our thoughts and choices are in our control. But this is partially true or may be not at all true. Do you believe the choices you are making in daily life are yours? What makes you to choose something over other thing. Again, this could be anything, anything in our daily life, even the simplest things. Right from choosing a news channel, movies, TV series, songs over another to choosing between green tea or ginger tea. Everything in your life is getting controlled by that 6th element, you never felt the presence of that. Which brand of smartphone you are going to buy, your lifestyles, where should be your next travel destinations, where would you go for honeymoon, is it Bali or Maldives or Paris ? Even which brand of underwear you are going to use is not controlled by you. Do you feel in charge? 
Our choices are limited, our mind has been manipulated ,convinced and sometimes forced to choose between those limited designed choices, designed by few set powerful people those who claims to be the Gods of the world , as I said earlier. They make you believe they are yours, there is no option of ‘None of the Above’ , at least not for them who never thought about this. And We cannot do anything about that, we are so powerless.

	</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	Sometimes we choose something over others so that we can be comfortable in front of the society, friends, family, random stranger met on the road, or an army of virtual people we never met. We care so much about thinking that what they are going to think if I do this, we are forced to choose the options according to these audience, even when we do not like. You prefer to talk in English with heavy words when you want to impress someone even you know you both know your mother tongue, you order stylish food, choose a drink over another, you try be more sophisticated  and gentle in front of people more than who you are. Even you are a good person you are busy in proving that you are a good human being. That is why you take pictures and post them on social media when you helped some needy or after feeding a stray dog, or post a picture when you planted a tree or did Home care activity ,initiated by someone else ,for that you had to wake up at 6 in morning unwillingly and forcefully so people come to know about you that you are good human being. You crave to get respect from others, you always want to prove and show that you are winning, not by real winning but by defeating someone, you do competition with.  These someone could be your friend, relatives, neighbors, your siblings or sometimes a virtual face you never saw in real life.
	</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	Don’t take me in wrong way, If your intentions are to inspire others and make a real difference then there is nothing wrong in winning or posting pictures of stray dogs, slum kids or your tree plantation on social media. But sad thing is that most of us don’t do this and think in this way, they don’t do this to inspire, to change and sad truth is people are hungry for attention, hungry for recognition even from the people they will never ever know in real life or have no business ,the people who don’t give a shit about what you do.  When earning real respect and recognition is tough, they use these methods, and this makes sense. This is easy, this is comfortable and does not require much effort. All they have to do is announce a beautiful line and post a picture when a soldier is martyred, when a child is raped, when a farmer committed suicide or when they did some charity or when superman is dead in a movie.
</br><i>	Hey buddy, i am also in the queue, I am also caring about this society and country. </i>
</br>
They should ask this question to themselves,<i> Do they really care?  If they do ,what else they are doing except posting pictures on social media. </i>

	</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	Well , I am no one to comment on everyone over this thread that stop doing this because most of the people I meet on internet or who might be reading this are virtual to me, I don’t know your intentions behind this. I also agree that at the time of writing this I may be under the influence of my own stereotypes; but I am trying my best not to be. I am sharing what I felt and experienced after doing analysis on people’s behavior, after monitoring them closely, very closely. And I find people are so vulnerable, you start giving them attention and analyzing them and they reveal who they are. 
	</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	Our society is overloaded with a particular mindset of people, who believe only expensive thing is good, who cares to show off and pretend to be someone else. How much property they have, how much they earn, fancy lifestyle, power, reputation, luxury vacations. I will not blame them for this, it’s the people who give them attention should be blamed. Hey, I want a lifestyle like him, I want to be the next Dan Bilzerian, no buddy wants to be the Change this society desperately needs. Our most part of society is inclined towards money minded orientation; we think if people have huge money, they have respect, they are happy, life is good. And that’s why everyone is chasing money, money and money, like a blind and mad camel running everywhere in an desert in search of water which is already loaded in his hump, he can’t realize he can survive for weeks without losing control . We also are doing same, putting everything on risk, destroying ethics, morals, values, and humanity and most of the times ruining self-happiness, inner peace, family, friends and precious life moments. You know the Rat race? well It’s just like that rat race and the you know the problem with rat race? 
<span class="mb-3 font-weight-bold"> Even you win, you are still a rat. </span>
	
	
	</br>
	I am not saying money is not important, money is needed to live a healthy life, and I agree on this point too that definition of healthy life is different from person to person but choosing money over everything, over self-happiness and inner peace is not a good idea, thinking you will get time to make memories  in future, may be after your retirement. Who knows what comes the next day when you wake up? Or maybe you will not wake up.
	
	</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	I feel sad to say but sometimes I find our society is really fucked up, really- really fucked up. Nobody tells you to do what makes you feel good, nobody says to do things you love. Our top priority is not living doing what we love, it is just making money and showing off to people that hey I am winning, and you are losing. We impress people whom we don’t even know. Our society is fucked up, that is why a valuable Ted video gets views in lakhs and a cheap comedy video gets in millions. There is something wrong.  These is definitely something wrong no one talks about.
	</span>
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	Well this is a very big topic and I want to write about it more, but I want you to think about this. Now I want to bring you back on the thing what I was trying to say. All I want to say that appearances can be deceptive, do not be part of that world full of fake people with false hope. Don’t get impressed by what you see, don’t just believe what you are being told, don’t get manipulated by those controlling Gods, think in all dimensions before you process something in your mind. Don’t become the slave of someone’s thinking, you are the one who should be in-charge, you are the one who should decide what is best for you, Never get embarrassed for the things you love or for being the person who you really are. If you think change in needed inside you, adopt that, make that change, but if you feel normal about yourself ,about your thought process , about the way you look at this world or what you do then it’s ok to be a weird one in this weird world. 
	</span>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	We know that in a day a human thinks avg 84000 thoughts, we can’t control all of them and we are not expected to do that too. But we can work on origin of those, source of those chain reactions of thoughts, we need to work on those triggers which are sitting inside our mind thinking they are immune to any external factors, replace them. Our mind is very powerful and wired in such a way that once we start thinking to something from a  new perspective ,from all possible dimensions, we will get answer for everything, right from what information we should process to what we want to be in our life, everything. All we must start thinking, without being biased to our triggers, like a lonely star in sky. 
	</span>
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
	<span style="margin-left:40px">
	At the end I would say Stop giving fuck about what people will think or say about you If you are not one of them or your ideas or your terms and condition to live your own life contradicts theirs. And the day you actually stop giving a fuck about them, you will never ever have to post a selfie after doing a charity or post a picture with a stray dog.
Do not get manipulated, do not become vulnerable to this society. Be inspired and be an inspiration, not a showoff. 
</br> </br>
So I am asking again,
<span class="mb-3 font-weight-bold"> are you gonna be the hurricane or the butterfly who can bring that hurricane?
